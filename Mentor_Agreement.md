# Student Mentor-Mentee Agreement 

Students will be working with me on a wide variety of projects.  One of the keys to successful mentoring relationships is establishing clear expectations between mentors and mentees. This agreement outlines the expectation for us working together.  The following is a high-level list of Expectations of the Mentee (add additional expectations as appropriate):

* Mentee will clearly and regularly communicate expectations, progress and questions with their mentor.
* Mentee will be proactive about advancing their studies and career. 
* Mentee will conduct work with integrity and interpersonal interactions with honesty.
* Mentee will be organized, keep track of their tasks, and communicate their progress.
* Mentee will regularly attend meetings, lab events and external events that progress them towards their goals.  Mentee’s will be on-time and give notice if they are unable to attend when expected. 
* Mentee will communicate their work effectively though practice (writing and presentations) with the lab and engaging multiple external communities. 

The follow is a high-level list of Expectations for the Mentor (add additional expectations as appropriate):

* Mentor will clearly communicate expectations about the mentee's responsibilities.
* Mentor will provide projects and tasks that are within the scope and ability of the mentee. 
* Mentor will provide feedback on progress and answer questions in a timely manner. 
* Mentor will communicate values by setting an example and modeling expectations.
* Mentor will provide advice and support to the mentee regarding work, personal and professional growth.
* Mentor will advocate for the Mentee though helping make connections, writing letters of support and stepping in if there are problems.

It is also important that we communicate and follow procedures to help us keep the above expectations.  The rest of the document includes specific policies and procedures we have used successfully in the past.  Please review the entire document, sign and turn it in to your mentor for discussion.

## 2. Schedule and Time Commitment

1. The Mentee’s first day is/was _______ and their planned last day is _________.
2. The Mentee is planning to work between _______ and  _______ hours per week with a minimum of  _______ hours per week.  Per MSU policies, full time students can work a maximum of 20 hours.  Non-full time students (i.e. summer students) may work a maximum of 40 hours a week.

    Furthermore:  
    i. Mentees may not count lunchtime or other work breaks as part of hours worked.  
    ii. Mentees are expected to notify their mentor when scheduling personal vacations and other obligations.

3. We have discussed the typical weekly work schedule for the mentee, which will be:




  


4. If the mentee must deviate from this schedule, then they will communicate this to the mentor at least __________ (weeks/days/hours) before the change occurs.

## 3. Communication:
Communications with your mentor will be through weekly meetings, weekly 3x3 reflections, emails and the group teams channels:

**_E-Mail_**: The best way to get a hold of your mentor is through MSU E-mail.  It is expected that you will check for messages at least twice a day (mornings and afternoons) during the workweek and once every three days on long weekends, breaks and vacations.  Although you are not expected to work on weekends, breaks or vacations, regular checking of email is still expected in case your mentor is trying to get a hold of you.

**_Weekly Meeting_**: You will meet with your supervisor during a regularly scheduled weekly meeting (times determined by the team members schedules).  Notification of meeting cancellations should be emailed to all invited participants before the meeting.  

**_Weekly Update_**: It is expected that the entire team will email each other a weekly Three-by-three (3x3) update which will be due every Friday.  The 3x3 update will consist of exactly three major topics with three bullet points in each topic. The three topics include; 1) What you did since your last update, 2) Challenges, Questions or problems you are having  3) Your plans for next week.   Each of the 9 bullets in the 3x3 report should be no longer than a couple of sentences. For item number 2 (Challenges, questions, or problems) try to either share something that the rest of the group may be able to help and/or include new research questions or projects you think may be interesting to pursue. Additional details can be placed in the same email after the update (not required).  A typical reflection would have the following format:

> Hello Team,
> 
> Below is my 3x3 reflection for the week. \<\< A few extra sentences to highlight something of importance\>>
>  - \<\<Your name>>
> 
> My accomplishments for the week:
> * \<\<First thing>>
> * \<\<Second thing>> 
> * \<\<Third thing>>
>
> Questions/Challenges:
> * \<\<First Question/Problem>>
> * \<\<Second Question/Problem>>
> * \<\<Third Question/Problem>>
>
> My plans for next week:
> * \<\<First goal>>
> * \<\<Second goal>>
> * \<\<Third goal>>
>
> \<\< Additional Details if needed>>
