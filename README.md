# Research Guidelines 
Documents I often use when working with students in my group. I am sharing them here to make them easily accessable. I welcome any pull requests with suggestions and I encourage other mentors to fork and modify these documents. Please let me know if you find them helpful:

* [Dirk's User Manual](User_Manual.md)
* [Author Guidelines](Author_Guidelines.md)
* [Mentor Agreement](Mentor_Agreement.md)
